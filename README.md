# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: exceeding the maximum recursion depth. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a factorial function that does not handle negative input correctly, leading to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The solution is provided in `factorial_solution.py` which adds input validation.
